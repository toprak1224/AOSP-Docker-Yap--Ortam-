**Compatibility:**
AOSP based Androids:
12, 12.1 (12L), 13DP1
13 DP2 & beta 1 (poorly compatible - not recommended)

**If you're updating from previous versions:**
Update your module via module update shortcut in Magisk

**To install, you will need to:**
Install LSPosed Zygisk (https://t.me/LSPosedArchives)
Install the zip file in Magisk
Reboot
Technically, the module should automatically activate itself in Lsposed and get its required root permissions. If didn't, please activate manually and reboot again
